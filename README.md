# Machine-Learning-Techniques-for-Time-Series-Forecasting

In my module 'Software Engineering Project', I worked with 6 of my classmates to create time series forecasting software for our client Microsoft. Time series forecasting is the use of datasets to predict the value of a given element at a future date.

Learning Python was my first task as I had no previous experience using this language. Once I had learned Python's syntax, I quickly began to enjoy using the language. I now plan on doing more projects using Python in my own time.

I began to learn about time series forecasting methods. Initially, I had very little experience with this topic as this was my first data science project. However, I managed to build up a base understanding of the topic before the project began. 

My main focus during this project was on the front end. I used the front end visualisation framework 'Dash' as well as some HTML and CSS to represent the time series. This was challenging as it was my first time working with all of the above tools. 

The end product of this project was the web application shown in the video above. 

How to use:
1. Have python 3 installed on your machine
2. Install virtualenv via pip 
3. Create an isolated python virtualenv

-To run web application: Run mainpage.py
-To run a regression test: Run regression.py
-Or alternatively: Run svr.py
